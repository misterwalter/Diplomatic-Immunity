The story of the third season of the Imperial Dawn campaign called Diplomatic Immunity, played in the Spring of 2019.

# The Main Cast

- Ara - A passionate young girl with great mastery of knives and moons.

- Ixze - A teenage deserter trying to find zer way in the world.

- Doktuh Dakog, MD - A doctor of great confidence and dubious skill.

- Jubilee - An old hand at the theater that really wanted to get out more.

- Master Novum Cain - A master of bone and flesh. He is NOT a good boy.

# Session 1: Redemption

Ara lifted her head. They was a grey and wrinkled elvish man across the table from her. That was weird, elves never got grey.

He smiled gently. "Are you ready, Ara? I don't wish to rush you."

She realized that she had no idea where she was, and jolted into alertness. The man seemed to be unarmed, and there wasn't anyone else around, but she couldn't move. Her hands and legs were bound together by some kind of magic, and she couldn't even see a window. That said, the chair that she was in was comfortable enough, and she still had her knife, so she decided to see what he had to say.

What he had to say was bullshit. Apparently she had been identified on the Deshton Reform raid, The Director's eyes had been two of The 10,000, and had managed to report back. Now Redemption had her sister in some kind of stasis bullshit, and they were going to give her up for adoption if Ara didn't knock over some Vershezulite cult. There was a lot of talk of reputational gains, and the limits of what this Sladaaji character could do to protect her, but it was all bullshit. He might have been telling the truth about not liking Deshton Reform, but there was no way to know and no reason to care. Seeing no better option, she agreed. He bonds were dispelled, she was given the name of her first squadmate, and a stack of unsettlingly meticulous dossiers detailing the targets.

---
Ixze wasn't hard to find. Ze was with Salve, doing zer best to heal the wounds of the city. Upon hearing that desertion charges might be pressed against zem despite their service to Salve, and that apparently only Redemption could help zem, Ixze started to turn towards joining up. Upon hearing that Ara needed help, Ixze made zer call.

---

The two returned to Sladaaji to get some answers regarding their mission, and the nature of their new teammates. Sladaaji did his best to answer Ixze's questions, but seemed uncomfortable all the same. When pressed as to what would happen if they got hurt, he perked up though, ushered them into another room, and bid them to greet their new healer.

Doktuh Dakog, MD, was partway through a surgery at the time, but he seemed more than happy to greet them all the same.

# Session 6: The Investigation Begins
After reassembling our horse, we got on our way again, and rode on. We passed out of the forest, and into the rolling Swamp. As the Stochastic Spires came into view throw the clouds on our left, the tumbled mountains became visible on our right. We turned to The Spires, and rode inland, away from the river.

We were quickly challenged by Naario and Bungus Bungo, who were strangers to everyone but Ixze. Ixze briefly panicked, until ze remembered that Naario had tried to help zer before. Naario called out to Ixze, and the two stepped to the side for a quick aside. Granted, the whole thing was being telepathically relayed to all of us, but we didn't see any reason to insult his discretion. He was friendly enough, and welcomed Ixze and the rest of us to the facility. He did warn us to be a lot more careful though. We got confirmation that Oc and Moog had ratted us out before, and apparently we blew some interview as well. It was a little disheartening, but it was good advice, so Ixze accepted it. Naario promised to bury the fact that Ixze was there in the report, and said that as long as the group did their business quietly, it shouldn't be a problem.

He asked zer about what ze was doing there, and Ixze answered honestly, saying that they were all there to see if they could help Santha, as well as to do an investigation for Redemption. He nodded, said that both of those were fine, which we appreciated. Then he said that his money was on the collapses being the result of chaos, not sabatoge, which we all thought was pretty suspicious.

With that they returned to group. Summary introductions were made, our Redemption papers were flashed, and we were on our way. Naario and Bungus led us through a maze of gravel dunes to a brick wall set into the side of a particularly large door, and we passed into the facility. As we did though, Ixze and Ara noticed one of The 10,000 eyes sticking to a divot in the wall, silently watching.

---

Once inside, Cain's horse was stabled in a giant underground hangar of sorts. The ground was covered in Technomantic vehicles and heavily strapped down skeleton mounts of all sorts. Naario and Bungus hopped off of their spiders, and their mounts skittered up the walls into a giant mesh of webs and girders that held dozens upon dozens of spiders. Naario split off from there, saying he had paperwork to do, and Bungus took us to our rooms.

Apparently one of the dormitories had been duplicated at one point, so we had plenty of space to ourselves. We each got our own room, and it didn't look like there was anybody else on the floor. Each of our doors had special handles that would only open for us, and security "of course", so we were mostly secure. We got ourselves settled in, helped ourselves to the truly excessive dental supplies in the room, and even got Bungus to slip a medic in for us without Doktuh Dakog noticing.

---

After a little while, a wrinkly little purple spora named Grigzo that uhh, had uhh, a ehhh, infuuuuuuriating ah, manner of...speech came and informed us that she would be our guide. Cain was declared her to be useless due to her lack of bones, but the rest of us tolerated her alright, at least until the questions started.

There had been three major catastrophes in the last month and a half.

The first was The Flickering. It happened about a mounth and a half ago. The wild-wise null field generators in the outmost ring had failed, leading to a cascade of generator failures across the facility as each lost of the support of the others around it and was overloaded in turn. Before this event, there were six towers in the Stochastic facility, but after that apparently a bunch of the towers just started disappearing and reappearing at random. Grigzo says that they've got it mostly stable now, but Tower Six still goes in and out sometimes. We made a note to avoid Tower Six.

The second was The Grasping Hunger. She didn't seem to want to talk about this one much, but from what we could get out of her, the wild-wise generators failed again, and everyone and everything started growing a whole lot of extra mouths. Those mouths were real hungry, too. Apparently this one was the most deadly, and the one that she's most surprised that they could fix, especially so completely.

The third was the Shuffling. The wild-wise generators failed again, to no one's surprise. Everything in the facility got displaced pretty randomly. This just sounded confusing at first, rather than dangerous. Then we heard about people showing up encased in the rock deep below the ground, and popping into the air a mile or so up. I guess whole labs haven't been rediscovered yet, and there are still digging crews trying to feel out where their missing coworkers might be. Most of the facility ended up underground, which explained the lack of visible towers or a real road outside.

Even with all this, or perhaps because of it, there was no single record of the catastrophes that we had been sent to solve. There were five different teams collating reports on different aspects of the events, but none were complete. Cain requested the reports anyway.

There was also, somehow, no document saying who actually worked for the Stochastices. There might be a few wildly outdated documents somewhere, but things had been so chaotic and secretive for so long that there was no real reason to think that any vaguely accurate document existed. With so many people showing up as volunteers, and so many people disappearing for various horrifying reasons in the triple catastrophes, people had just started working with the people that they knew personally to make sure that the work that they understood got done. That fact that anyone was getting fed, much less paid, was nothing short of a miracle.

With those disappointments in mind, everyone but hesitated for a moment to think of a plan. Ara, true to her nature, demanded to be taken to the Chronomancers. Grigzo obliged, and led us through the maze. Ara and Cain mostly remembered the way back, but the rest of us were hopelessly lost.

---

Grigzo got us past reception and got us ten minutes with the Chronomancers. We tried the door, found that it opened, and walked into a large, unground room. A few nerdy looking wizards were tossing tarps over something glowy in the middle of the room, and there was a large radius marked off around the device with great big WARNING labels. One of them, Dr. Denly, came over and introduced himself. He was friendly enough, but not as useful as Ara would have liked.

Apparently the Chronomaster, Dr. Denly's boss, had gone off on some kind of trip two weeks ago, and was supposed to have returned last week. She might have been able to help Santha, but he sure couldn't. He went off on a tangent about how much he disliked the Chronomastet title, which didn't feel totally necessary, but we let him anyway. It wasn't our jobs on the line.

He did fill us in on a few details of the catastrophes though, which was nice. Apparently there were about 180 null field generators, and they had originally been set up in two rings around the facility, with a few more added in ad hoc until The Shuffling. There had been collapses before, but only one in the four and a half years that he had been there, and it was two years ago now. He personally didn't suspect anyone, but admitted that it was possible that someone was doing all of it on purpose.

---

After that, we decided to check the generators. Grigzo led us to the outer ring, which was a sort of long, circular hallway with about 100 or so generators in it, all spaced out about 50 meters apart around the entire facility. There was nobody watching the door, but oddly enough, Grigzo couldn't get through. We could though, so we stomped our way in and left her outside. It was kinda funny, but it also made us a bit more suspicious of her as well.

Ixze and Doktuh Dakog MD set about investigating the generators. They were fairly large metal cylinders, a few meters long, and about a meter in radius. Inside they had some kind of giant scroll that was constantly spinning and burning on the outer edge. They seemed pretty durable, and when Doktuh Dakog stuck his gretchen into one, the gretchen lost pretty abruptly. Luckily, Cain was on hand to reassemble the poor thing, and nobody felt the need for further experimentation. We got a little bit fo a shock a moment later when some parts of the gretchen that we handn't gotten back fell out of the bottom, and closer inspection revealed a hand-width slot in the metal casing at the bottom of the generator.

Ixze walked a loop around the tunnel, checking for weakpoints, and ze didn't find any of those. Ze did find a place where the trail of cables and generators seemed to wrap up the wall, onto the ceailing, and back to along the other wall to the floor again, which we all agreed probably wasn't good. The fact that there was a generator bolted upside down to the ceiling didn't really feel right either.

Perplexed and a little frustrated, we had Grigzo guide us back to our rooms, and we retired for the night.

# Session 7: Plans and Accidents

As most of us bedded down for the night, Master Novum Cain set to work on a new invention, and Folium ventured out into the facility for a little investigation of her own.

First, she set up panic buttons in each of our rooms, so that we could immediately sound an alarm if anything happened.

Second, she got to work interrogating the various decorative potted plants of the facility. She mostly just heard a lot of disappointment over the lack of current lighting. There are very few plants that are comfortable underground, and she wasn't speaking to any of them. Beyond that though, she got a consistent vibe of stress and suspicion from the people there now, when things didn't used to be that way. Everything was toxic now, and nice people weren't so nice anymore.

With that, she returned to the outer ring of generators, and did one more inspection pass. Looking at the insides, she was able to piece together that the generators seemed to work by generating long sheets of runes constantly, combining those runes in different ways by laying them on top of eachother, and burning the paper with the runes once it had reached the edge of the roll. It was definitely pretty advanced.

The tunnel as a whole seemed much the same as before, except that this time, two generators were up on the ceiling instead of just one. Folium noted this with some trepedation, and set to work. By morning, she had set a sapling in front of every generator, with orders to observe without attacking if anyone should come by. After the daily inspector has passed through, she also installed alarm traps on each of the three doors into the ring tunnel. As she did so, she noticed that there was only one generator on the ceiling again, even though there was still no evidence of them being moved or reinstalled by normal means.

With that, Folium came back just in time for breakfast.

---

After a hearty breakfast of mac and cheese waffles, lasanga pancakes, and ravioli eggs from the amazingly well stocked cafeteria, we set out to interview Brib Nieblich one of the three Blessed administrators. Brib was a large, dark grey stoneborn with two red sabers at his sides, and a remarkably fast pace for a stoneborn. He was meeting with a researcher when we ran into him, but was happy to answer questions anyway.

He was in charge of security at the facility, and was remarkably chipper about it, given the state of things. Ixze, it should be noted, was not as excited about things, as ze realized that ze had actually met Brib before, however briefly. The last time that Ixze had been here, Brib had demanded that ze and the rest of the party at the time be immediately killed. He had even concussed Naario and Bungus when they had failed to immediately comply. Now Brib had had his reasons, but it was still unsettling at best, and Ixze had a feeling that the fact that Brib had never actually laid eyes on zer was a very fortunate thing indeed.

Despite all that, the conversation went pretty smoothly. Brib reiterated that there was probably nothing going on beyond the pressure spikes, and that those were both unprecedented and accounted for. According to Brib, they had been coming every time a significant force or entity entered the sovereign's realm. When we asked why he wasn't worried about more, Brib said that his reasons were classified, but cited the expertise of a Dr. Blishleigh, who was developing technology to record magical pressure events.

If nothing else, it was nice to get confirmation that at least one of the Blessed wasn't actively trying to kill us. We even managed to get a meeting with Cal Dayileki, the Blessed that developed that generators, set up for the next day.

---

After that, Doktah Dakog insisted on inspecting the medical facilities. We were all a little worried about that, but he went anyway, and Cain followed. The two were greeted by a hangar sized room that had been filled with beds, patients, and frantic healers. After trying and failing to procure a tour guide, they wandered over to the morgue for a little independent investigation and/or supply run. What they found did not disappoint.

Doktuh Dakog MD talked shop with an increasingly concerned mortician as Cain dug through the bodybags. It didn't take long for the mortician to start doubting Doktuh Dakog's MD, but Cain didn't need much time to find what he was after. Cain quietly zipped open a bodybag and casually borrowed an arm from the mortal remains of Dr. Spindling, a former "Chronosplicing researcher". We weren't 100% on what that title meant, but it sounded important enough, and Cain figured that the researcher's arm might come in handy for opening doors.

You might fault the two morticians for not paying closer attention to him, but as that was happening, Doktuh Dakog MD was proving his mettle as a medical professional by slicing open important veins in his arm and bleeding all over everyone. So their plates were pretty full. As soon as Cain had the arm, Doktuh Dakog declared victory, and the two exited the scene.

---

That night, Cain was putting finishing touches on his newest creation when there was a knock at his door. Feeling suspicious at the timing, he sent a bone drone to look through the peephole on the door instead of going himself.

As soon as the drone moved up to the peephole, the door was kicked in with incredible force, knocking the drone away wildly as a pitch black blobular figure smashed into the room. It would have been a hell of an entrance if Cain had answered the door, but he hadn't. He was in fact sitting a few feet away at his desk, activating Folium's panic button, and charging his new toy: A gigantic necrotic cannon made of bone, with a barrel constructed of not one, nor two, nor three, but four ribcages.

As the cannon screamed to life and the alarm blared, the intruder decided that tonight was not their night, and ran. Beams of necrotic energy, several sets of footsteps, and confusing shouting pursued them down the hallway. They took a hit to their side, but managed to keep running, just barely reaching the stairs before being hit in the back with another and faceplanting. By the time they had regained their senses, trees had sprouted from the floor around them, locking them in, and they were surrounded by shouting voices.

# Session 8: Tracking the Beast

We gave the intruder a good shouting over, but they didn't seem to budge. Then we tried the old "bad cop, bad cop, bad cop, bad cop, rookie" routine, but that just got them panicked. Even when Doktuh Dakog started "demonstrating" again, our weird prisoner wouldn't say anything. They just looked terrified and confused, and ended up huddling into as much of a ball as they could without saying anything useful. We didn't like that, so Folium wrapped them tighter in wooden bonds so that only their face could move, and covered them in thorns. That didn't work either though, and by the time the rest of the guards arrived we were discussing the many merits of just having Cain kill and ressurrect them until they talked.

With Naario and Bungus coming in on their spiders, we decided to leave things to the professionals. Unfortunately, the professionals didn't really know any better than we did, and so Naario and Bungus hit the same brick wall as us. Bungus ended up just wrapping the intruder in spiderweb and having his spider stick the poor bastard with something that knocked them out cold. Folium and Cain hopped on the backs of the spiders, and those five all rode back to some security hangar. The rest of us all had to sleep, so we stumbled back to our rooms and did just that.

---

Once the five reached the security hangar, our captive was quickly dropped on a table that had convenient hand and ankle shackles, and quickly chained. Naario then spritzed them with a little something that evaporated the web, and promptly ran off to make sure that guards were posted by our bedrooms.

Once everybody had had a chance to cool off, we had a chance to look over our captive a little more thoroughly. Though we'd initially thought them to be cloaked in dark grey, they appeared to just have near black leathery skin all over their body. In fact, they were completely naked, and utterly devoid of any kind of genitals. Their general shape was broadly orcish, but no one would call them an orc without being told so first. They carried nothing, and seemed sweaty to the touch. Worst of all, a slight stench of old fish hung over them.

Cain started to get geared up to do the whole necromantic interrogation thing, and was a little disappointed when Folium hit a breakthrough.

---

Folium started to press our captive on what exactly their plan was, now that they were captured, and that seemed to get a crack. They seemed to start to realize that they didn't really have one. They didn't really know much of anything. Not only were they unsure of who they had been working for, they weren't even really sure of who or what they were. As it turns out, all that we really had to do was offer a helping hand, and they fell right into it. The only friction came when they complained of exhaustion and begged to be allowed to sleep, but Cain used a necromantic spell to rid them of any need to sleep, eat, breath, age, or really do much of anything other than talk to us for a few days, which got them back on track.

Our captive explained that they had just woken up in a hallway with an understanding that they had to go to a certain room, beat up whoever was inside, and leave quietly. They knew the directions to that room, but not much else. They didn't know why they were doing it, or why that room in particular. The only other other thing that they had been sure of was that it was very important to act quickly, so they had rushed to their mission without a second thought.

Through the interview, Folium was able to get the list of directions that she needed, and we got what we needed to trace back to the spot where our captive had started. A psychic call roused the rest of the group, and we all met up at a very smelly carpet.

---

Once we got there, the location was obvious. Smack dab in the center of a rug in the middle of a long hallway, was a gigantic patch of crusty disgusting dried fluid. The carpet was ruined, but our investigation was wrapping up with surprising speed. We poked at a it a little, but it was only once Grigzo arrived that we figured out the source. Grigzo announced that it was clearly the work of a certain Dr. Grimgen, and within a few minutes, Brib Nieblich was on the scene. After an almost concerningly brief period of contemplation, Brib determined that we needed to interrogate the frontdeskatoon of Dr. Kholani's hangar, and probably kill them all.

Within a few minutes time, we were having a chat with the receptioneer as Brib pinned the poor guy to the waiting room couch and Folium sealed the hangar door with wood. He reported no odd activity within the hangar, but Ara looked into his thoughts, and saw that he had been putting his head down and not looking when certain shipments had been taken in and out of the hangar. We all thought that was pretty suspicious, Brib most of all. In fact, Brib thought it was so suspicious that he punched a hole clean through the receptioneer's face and out the other side.

We were startled to say the least, but when Brib ordered us to form up and prepare to purge the hangar, we didn't hesitate. Whatever was on the other side of that hangar door wasn't going to be half as scary as what was on our side.

# Session 9: Spark and Sword

The raid mostly broke into two parts. The organized bit, and the messy bit.

Folium activated a good chunk of her fulminated vitriol, and stuffed in into the gaping hole in the receptioneer's head. There was plenty of room. Then Cain and Dakog worked together to not just reanimate the corpse with a face made out of other bit of skin and such from other parts of the body where they "wouldn't be missed". I couldn't give details because I didn't watch, but Ara did stick a moon orb on it and Cain's drone after they were done.

Once they got that done, Folium peeled the wood off of the door, and Brib confidently walked in. The hangar was pretty huge, at least a few hundred meters long. All around the entrance big wooden crates and metal tanks of supplies were stacked. A few researchers were tinkering with some kind of limbed technomantic wagon whose arms were wrapped around one of the giant tanks. Behind them were two giant machines, the smaller of which was buried under a pile of rubble. They were both kicking off enough noise and steam to fill the room. One researcher looked up, and then called out that Brib was here as she walked over with a smile. She seemed friendly enough, and was more than happy to comply when Brib asked her to gather all the researchers at the door for an announcement. We all hung back, and did our best not to show our horror as nearly two dozen researchers, including the truly massive Dr. Kholani, stepped away from their stations across the hangar to cluster around Brib. Brib began to lecture ominously about the importance of loyalty, and Cain set the plan into motion.

The corpse of the receptioneer stepped forward almost steadily behind Brib, keeping behind him until until it passed him and made a beeline for the wagon. A few researchers noticed, one of them even pointed quizzically. None of them moved an inch before the corpse reached its target though, so every single one was in the blast radius when the corpse headbutted the wagon, setting off enough vitriol to blow them all to chunks. Only Dr. Kholani surived the inital impact, and she didn't survive the second bomb that Folium chucked her way.

Brib was of course, completely unharmed.

Fuck me.

That put an end to the organized bit though, and we started to scout ahead into the hangar. There was no way it was going to be that easy.

Brib stumbled onto a few cowering researchers and his fists through them with unnerving satisfaction.

Ara's moon orb happened to be stuck to a piece of head that flew most of the way to the machines, so she moon-hopped over to it, instantly putting herself far from the rest of us.

Ixze climbed up onto the ceiling for a better look, trusting her sticky fingers to carry her.

Dakog, Cain, and Folium stepped cautiously forward across the open floor, fanning out as approached the giant machines.

Ara made contact first, spotting a few blobby figures as she climbed through the rubble. They looked just like the figure that had tried to beat up Cain the night before, except that they were wetter and whiter, almost translucent. A few noticed her and started to chase her, so ducked around in a different direction, and ended up in a dead-end tunnel that gave her just the slightest view of a researcher frantically praying through a hole in the rock. She wanted to stab him, but she couldn't get through easily, and he had a few pale figures with him, so she sent a thought to Cain, asking him to fly his drone to the top of the larger machine. Just as the swarm of pale figures closed in on her, she moon-hopped over to Cain's drone, and dropped lightly onto the top of the massive machine, just below Ixze.

From there the two could see two researchers performing the same kind of prayer at altars on the far side of the large machine. We couldn't make out what they were saying over the noise of the machinery, but when we saw three more pale figures stagger out of the machine between them, dripping pus and staring around wild-eyed, we felt we had a pretty good guess. Unfortunately they joined about twenty of their fellows, who were swarming around the researchers. With Folium, Cain, and Dakog just barely pushing into the rubble and in no position to help her if something went wrong, Ara cloaked herself in darkness, jumped down onto the nearest researcher, and put her knife right through his neck.

Ixze panicked and started shouting wildly about how this was all a false flag operation, in an attempt to try to distract anyone ze could. Foolish as it was, it probably saved Ara's life. Ara was immediately swarmed by the pale figures, who blindly struck and clawed as they surrounded her. Ara could have easily bested any one of them, but she was suddenly beset by two dozen, half a dozen of which were within immediate reach. The elven child dove and ducked and danced though, and only took one serious hit to her side before moon-hopping right over to the other researcher to push her luck even further. She stuck him in just one blow too, which is good because she had a dozen pale figures on her before she could so much as turn around.

As that was happening, Brib, Cain, Dakog, and Folium were frantically pushing through the rubble tunnels trying to catch up. A few of us (not Brib, of course) burned themselves on some weird crystals before Folium was able to elementally tap into them, grind them into gravel, and fling them into an oncoming wave of pale figures. It didn't kill many, but it did block off one of two paths, and all the mere mortals piled into the right hand tunnel while Brib showed off by walking through the burning crystals to take the left. That left him considerably closer to the pre-teen that was about to be ripped limb from limb, but when we tried to get him to rush over and back her up, he just responded that "she will prove herself, or she will learn." Now that wasn't strictly true, as the dead know nothing and she was about to die, but there was some logic to it, so we let it slide and pushed through our own tunnel.

It wasn't long before we found the same tunnel that had stymied Ara before, but we had a significant tactical advantage: Cain's cannon. As soon as he laid eyes on the researcher, he charged, aimed, and put a glowing green hole right through the distracted idiot's face. The rubble collapsed a bit and the pale figures started to swarm towards us in the tunnels, but Cain held down the trigger, Folium tossed phos-poppers and her last vitriol, and Dakog slapped our guts back in whenever they got close enough to cut us.

Ara took a harsh hit to the face and nearly lost consciousness, but was able to keep it together just enough to moon-hop back to the rooftop drone one more time, where she spent the rest of the battle screaming down at the pale figures as they swarmed into our killbox.

# Session 3-10: Pack Up and Pack Out

After we killed off the last of the pale figures, we did one last sweep of the hangar, and everything seemed to be clean. At least the creepy things weren't much for hiding.

Dakog patched up a few of us, Ara lied about her wounds, and Brib wiped his gorey hands on the clothes of a fairly intact researcher. he congradulated us on all surviving the battle, saying that he hadn't expected that. His twin red swords were still clean though, so I guess he hadn't been that concerned. He'd expected us to die, and he hadn't even been trying. Fucking Blessed.

We all did our part in the cleanup. Brib didn't want knowledge of these techniques to sprad unnecessarily he said, so it was best to keep the document destruction limited to those that wouldn't understand them anyway. He went on about how it was a real shame that the techniques hadn't panned out, being able to endlessly replicate people would have totally eliminated their need for volunteers to aid them in their essential work, but now it seemed that they would have to continue to depend upon Mirka's people in order to best serve. We shrugged it off mostly, it wasn't really our problem. We'd solved the mystery of who was sabatoging the generators, and so our job was done. All we really wanted to do was go home and have Sladaaji tell us that we were free and clear.

So Folium worked up a giant batch of vitriol to destroy the two machines, Dakog scavenged the bodies for any good organs, and the rest of us scrubbed gore, burned notes, and smashed prototypes. It was actually kinda fun, almost idyllic, in a way. Just having everybody helping eachother out and chatting as we worked was really calming, though in retrospect it said a lot about of our comfort level with death.

It started to fall apart when Dakog decided to gather up all the researchers ID badges that he could find.
```
Dr. Hajj Kholani
Dr. Skoov
Dr. Hixly
Dr. Ganatrixus
Dr. Heidel
Dr. Spindling
```

Now some of these names might seem familiar to you. Dr. Hajj Kholani is clearly the head researcher here, and we've certainly heard her name before, but it's Dr. Spindling who really causes us problems.

You see, we ran into Dr. Spindling before. In the morgue. When we took his arm. From his corpse.

Which left us with two possibilities:

First and preferably, there were two Dr. Spindlings working for the Stochastices. Both are now dead, and this is a tragedy.

If not though, that left the chance that one or both of the two Dr. Spindlings weren't real. It's possible that the previous Dr. Spindling was fake, but it's not really clear who would be trying to fool who with just another corpse in the morgue. The truth is, nobody was looking until we randomly stumbled into there. It's unlikely that anybody even knew that we knew a Dr. Spindling was dead. So if anything, it's probably the case that this Dr. Spindling in front of us isn't the real Dr. Spindling. Which means that the technology that they've developed here is far better than they've let on, which means they're lying to us, and they're willing to get a lot of people (copies?) killed to sell us on that lie.

All of the sudden we had no idea what was going on. Some of us thought that it was some kind of mistake, though I couldn't say what kind of mistake it would be.

"Is there something going on that I should know about?" Brib slowly suggested, as we huddled over the bodies.

We tend towards honesty, so one of us said that we thought that we had seen a dead Dr. Spindling before, in the morgue.

Brib raised an eyebrow, casually placed his scab-flecked hands on his hips, and asked us what we thought of that.

It's times like this thatteam telepathy really pays off, because after an exceptionally brief mental shouting match, we all agreed out loud that we had no idea, weird stuff happens sometimes, and he should probably look into it after we leave. It's nothing major though, and we weren't worried about it.

Brib smiled, said that he appreciated us pointing it out, and that he'd do just that. We blew up the machines with the vitriol, and let Brib walk us back to our rooms. Helpfully enough, Naario was there again to watch over us as we slept and recovered from that battle. When we got up he was still there, and everyone was eager to have him help us gather up our stuff and head directly down to the hangar to leave. We hopped onto Cain's skeletal horse, and got ourselves out of there.

On the way back to Montilew, we saw a strange old dwarven man riding a camel, weighted down with some kind of haul. We tried to ride close enough to get a better look at him, but he saw us and disappeared before we could greet him.

Sladaaji was pleased, as usual. We told him more or less the same story we told you, and he seemed satisfied with our performance. He didn't seem to mind that we'd just cheesed it at the end, he said that we told him everything he'd needed to know, and that we had helped to defeat a very dangerous band of heretics. He said that when he promulgated news of our success our stars would surely rise, and our crimes would be largely forgiven.

"Largely."

That was a load of bullshit, and we were all pretty well sick of acting like it wasn't. We had done so much for this grinning idiot, and he wasn't delivering anything for us.

Sladaaji said that we shouldn't expect instant forgiveness for attacking a school and murdering the administrators.

We said that it was a fucked up weird magic child torture dungeon, not a school.

Sladaaji said that was just a matter of perspective.

After a brief mental debate of whether or not we should kill him right then and there, we shot back that it really wasn't. It was absolutely objectively a fucked up weird magic child torture dungeon.

Sladaaji said that was a perfectly valid viewpoint, but it wasn't a viewpoint that everyone shared, and if we wanted to survive in this world we had to learn to see things from the other side.

The vote to kill Sladaaji was considerably closer that time, but we opted to give him an ultimatum instead. One more job. Something that would clear our names. If he couldn't guarantee that, we would walk right now.

He asked us if we were sure, and said he didn't have much that would be enough to clear us. Truthfully, there was only one thing that had a chance of doing so.

Sure. Fine. It's a rough mission. We can take it. What, do we have to kill a Blessed or something?

"Not quite," Sladaaji replied, "I need you to kill three."

# Session 3-11: The Target

Sladaaji reached into his desk and pulled out a few active papers, explaining as he did that during the class seven certain parties had made certain decisions. In a moment of desperation thousands of servants were Blessed, and while the action allowed victory, the losses had been almost total, and the fallout has been dramatic.

Each of us took a page and started to play with it, scrolling through 8 dossiers.

Sladaaji assured us that it had been confirmed that only three were still alive, but that those three had been carving a path of devastation through a wildlands valley a nineday or so from the site of the class seven. Their motive was unknown, but they were freshly promoted and appeared unworthy of the status. If revocation was possible that would have been preferable. The wildlanders are perfectly capable of standing against most threats, but as it was, the violence was stirring old sentiments that were best forgotten. The three had to be put down, and had to be put down by servants. Anything less would breed treason.

We just stared at the dossiers. These people seemed like either perfectly decent people, or unkillable elite warriors, with a few fitting both descriptions. And if they were Blessed, the mission seemed absurdly suicidal.

We sat down with the dossiers, and got to work on a plan. I've attached my copy below for posterity's sake.

## Squad 453
A rogue unit operating without any shred of decency.

### Gear:
May carry seeds or other such greenery. If so, DO NOT TOUCH THE GREENERY. Leave it contained by whatever methods they are using. Fire is ineffective in damaging it.

### Backstory:
A squad of Blessed promoted to deal with the class seven event. In the course of the event, they took five casualties, and the remaining three appear to have gone berserk, carving a swath of atrocities across the wildlands. They need to be put down.

### Style:
Extremely brutal, likely extremely heretical. Full capabilities unknown.

### Members 8+1:
