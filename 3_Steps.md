The story of the third season of the Imperial Dawn campaign called Diplomatic Immunity, played in the Spring of 2019.

# The Main Cast

- Ara - A passionate young girl with great mastery of knives and moons.

- Ixze - A teenage deserter trying to find zer way in the world.

- Doktuh Dakog, MD - A doctor of great confidence and dubious skill.

- Jubilee - An old hand at the theater that really wanted to get out more.

- Master Novum Cain - A master of bone and flesh. He is NOT a good boy.

# Session 1: Redemption

Ara lifted her head. They was a grey and wrinkled elvish man across the table from her. That was weird, elves never got grey.

He smiled gently. "Are you ready, Ara? I don't wish to rush you."

She realized that she had no idea where she was, and jolted into alertness. The man seemed to be unarmed, and there wasn't anyone else around, but she couldn't move. Her hands and legs were bound together by some kind of magic, and she couldn't even see a window. That said, the chair that she was in was comfortable enough, and she still had her knife, so she decided to see what he had to say.

What he had to say was bullshit. Apparently she had been identified on the Deshton Reform raid, The Director's eyes had been two of The 10,000, and had managed to report back. Now Redemption had her sister in some kind of stasis bullshit, and they were going to give her up for adoption if Ara didn't knock over some Vershezulite cult. There was a lot of talk of reputational gains, and the limits of what this Sladaaji character could do to protect her, but it was all bullshit. He might have been telling the truth about not liking Deshton Reform, but there was no way to know and no reason to care. Seeing no better option, she agreed. He bonds were dispelled, she was given the name of her first squadmate, and a stack of unsettlingly meticulous dossiers detailing the targets.

Ixze wasn't hard to find. Ze was with Salve, doing zer best to heal the wounds of the city. Upon hearing that desertion charges might be pressed against zem despite their service to Salve, and that apparently only Redemption could help zem, Ixze started to turn towards joining up. Upon hearing that Ara needed help, Ixze made zer call.

---

The two returned to Sladaaji to get some answers regarding their mission, and the nature of their new teammates. Sladaaji did his best to answer Ixze's questions, but seemed uncomfortable all the same. When pressed as to what would happen if they got hurt, he perked up though, ushered them into another room, and bid them to greet their new healer.

Doktuh Dakog, MD, was partway through a surgery at the time, but he seemed more than happy to greet them all the same.

# Session 6: The Investigation Begins
After reassembling our horse, we got on our way again, and rode on. We passed out of the forest, and into the rolling Swamp. As the Stochastic Spires came into view throw the clouds on our left, the tumbled mountains became visible on our right. We turned to The Spires, and rode inland, away from the river.

We were quickly challenged by Naario and Bungus Bungo, who were strangers to everyone but Ixze. Ixze briefly panicked, until ze remembered that Naario had tried to help zer before. Naario called out to Ixze, and the two stepped to the side for a quick aside. Granted, the whole thing was being telepathically relayed to all of us, but we didn't see any reason to insult his discretion. He was friendly enough, and welcomed Ixze and the rest of us to the facility. He did warn us to be a lot more careful though. We got confirmation that Oc and Moog had ratted us out before, and apparently we blew some interview as well. It was a little disheartening, but it was good advice, so Ixze accepted it. Naario promised to bury the fact that Ixze was there in the report, and said that as long as the group did their business quietly, it shouldn't be a problem.

He asked zer about what ze was doing there, and Ixze answered honestly, saying that they were all there to see if they could help Santha, as well as to do an investigation for Redemption. He nodded, said that both of those were fine, which we appreciated. Then he said that his money was on the collapses being the result of chaos, not sabatoge, which we all thought was pretty suspicious.

With that they returned to group. Summary introductions were made, our Redemption papers were flashed, and we were on our way. Naario and Bungus led us through a maze of gravel dunes to a brick wall set into the side of a particularly large door, and we passed into the facility. As we did though, Ixze and Ara noticed one of The 10,000 eyes sticking to a divot in the wall, silently watching.

---

Once inside, Cain's horse was stabled in a giant underground hangar of sorts. The ground was covered in Technomantic vehicles and heavily strapped down skeleton mounts of all sorts. Naario and Bungus hopped off of their spiders, and their mounts skittered up the walls into a giant mesh of webs and girders that held dozens upon dozens of spiders. Naario split off from there, saying he had paperwork to do, and Bungus took us to our rooms.

Apparently one of the dormitories had been duplicated at one point, so we had plenty of space to ourselves. We each got our own room, and it didn't look like there was anybody else on the floor. Each of our doors had special handles that would only open for us, and security "of course", so we were mostly secure. We got ourselves settled in, helped ourselves to the truly excessive dental supplies in the room, and even got Bungus to slip a medic in for us without Doktuh Dakog noticing.

---

After a little while, a wrinkly little purple spora named Grigzo that uhh, had uhh, a ehhh, infuuuuuuriating ah, manner of...speech came and informed us that she would be our guide. Cain was declared her to be useless due to her lack of bones, but the rest of us tolerated her alright, at least until the questions started.

There had been three major catastrophes in the last month and a half.

The first was The Flickering. It happened about a mounth and a half ago. The wild-wise null field generators in the outmost ring had failed, leading to a cascade of generator failures across the facility as each lost of the support of the others around it and was overloaded in turn. Before this event, there were six towers in the Stochastic facility, but after that apparently a bunch of the towers just started disappearing and reappearing at random. Grigzo says that they've got it mostly stable now, but Tower Six still goes in and out sometimes. We made a note to avoid Tower Six.

The second was The Grasping Hunger. She didn't seem to want to talk about this one much, but from what we could get out of her, the wild-wise generators failed again, and everyone and everything started growing a whole lot of extra mouths. Those mouths were real hungry, too. Apparently this one was the most deadly, and the one that she's most surprised that they could fix, especially so completely.

The third was the Shuffling. The wild-wise generators failed again, to no one's surprise. Everything in the facility got displaced pretty randomly. This just sounded confusing at first, rather than dangerous. Then we heard about people showing up encased in the rock deep below the ground, and popping into the air a mile or so up. I guess whole labs haven't been rediscovered yet, and there are still digging crews trying to feel out where their missing coworkers might be. Most of the facility ended up underground, which explained the lack of visible towers or a real road outside.

Even with all this, or perhaps because of it, there was no single record of the catastrophes that we had been sent to solve. There were five different teams collating reports on different aspects of the events, but none were complete. Cain requested the reports anyway.

There was also, somehow, no document saying who actually worked for the Stochastices. There might be a few wildly outdated documents somewhere, but things had been so chaotic and secretive for so long that there was no real reason to think that any vaguely accurate document existed. With so many people showing up as volunteers, and so many people disappearing for various horrifying reasons in the triple catastrophes, people had just started working with the people that they knew personally to make sure that the work that they understood got done. That fact that anyone was getting fed, much less paid, was nothing short of a miracle.

With those disappointments in mind, everyone but hesitated for a moment to think of a plan. Ara, true to her nature, demanded to be taken to the Chronomancers. Grigzo obliged, and led us through the maze. Ara and Cain mostly remembered the way back, but the rest of us were hopelessly lost.

---

Grigzo got us past reception and got us ten minutes with the Chronomancers. We tried the door, found that it opened, and walked into a large, unground room. A few nerdy looking wizards were tossing tarps over something glowy in the middle of the room, and there was a large radius marked off around the device with great big WARNING labels. One of them, Dr. Denly, came over and introduced himself. He was friendly enough, but not as useful as Ara would have liked.

Apparently the Chronomaster, Dr. Denly's boss, had gone off on some kind of trip two weeks ago, and was supposed to have returned last week. She might have been able to help Santha, but he sure couldn't. He went off on a tangent about how much he disliked the Chronomastet title, which didn't feel totally necessary, but we let him anyway. It wasn't our jobs on the line.

He did fill us in on a few details of the catastrophes though, which was nice. Apparently there were about 180 null field generators, and they had originally been set up in two rings around the facility, with a few more added in ad hoc until The Shuffling. There had been collapses before, but only one in the four and a half years that he had been there, and it was two years ago now. He personally didn't suspect anyone, but admitted that it was possible that someone was doing all of it on purpose.

---

After that, we decided to check the generators. Grigzo led us to the outer ring, which was a sort of long, circular hallway with about 100 or so generators in it, all spaced out about 50 meters apart around the entire facility. There was nobody watching the door, but oddly enough, Grigzo couldn't get through. We could though, so we stomped our way in and left her outside. It was kinda funny, but it also made us a bit more suspicious of her as well.

Ixze and Doktuh Dakog MD set about investigating the generators. They were fairly large metal cylinders, a few meters long, and about a meter in radius. Inside they had some kind of giant scroll that was constantly spinning and burning on the outer edge. They seemed pretty durable, and when Doktuh Dakog stuck his gretchen into one, the gretchen lost pretty abruptly. Luckily, Cain was on hand to reassemble the poor thing, and nobody felt the need for further experimentation. We got a little bit fo a shock a moment later when some parts of the gretchen that we handn't gotten back fell out of the bottom, and closer inspection revealed a hand-width slot in the metal casing at the bottom of the generator.

Ixze walked a loop around the tunnel, checking for weakpoints, and ze didn't find any of those. Ze did find a place where the trail of cables and generators seemed to wrap up the wall, onto the ceailing, and back to along the other wall to the floor again, which we all agreed probably wasn't good. The fact that there was a generator bolted upside down to the ceiling didn't really feel right either.

Perplexed and a little frustrated, we had Grigzo guide us back to our rooms, and we retired for the night.

# Session 7: Plans and Accidents

As most of us bedded down for the night, Master Novum Cain set to work on a new invention, and Folium ventured out into the facility for a little investigation of her own.

First, she set up panic buttons in each of our rooms, so that we could immediately sound an alarm if anything happened.

Second, she got to work interrogating the various decorative potted plants of the facility. She mostly just heard a lot of disappointment over the lack of current lighting. There are very few plants that are comfortable underground, and she wasn't speaking to any of them. Beyond that though, she got a consistent vibe of stress and suspicion from the people there now, when things didn't used to be that way. Everything was toxic now, and nice people weren't so nice anymore.

With that, she returned to the outer ring of generators, and did one more inspection pass. Looking at the insides, she was able to piece together that the generators seemed to work by generating long sheets of runes constantly, combining those runes in different ways by laying them on top of eachother, and burning the paper with the runes once it had reached the edge of the roll. It was definitely pretty advanced.

The tunnel as a whole seemed much the same as before, except that this time, two generators were up on the ceiling instead of just one. Folium noted this with some trepedation, and set to work. By morning, she had set a sapling in front of every generator, with orders to observe without attacking if anyone should come by. After the daily inspector has passed through, she also installed alarm traps on each of the three doors into the ring tunnel. As she did so, she noticed that there was only one generator on the ceiling again, even though there was still no evidence of them being moved or reinstalled by normal means.

With that, Folium came back just in time for breakfast.

---

After a hearty breakfast of mac and cheese waffles, lasanga pancakes, and ravioli eggs from the amazingly well stocked cafeteria, we set out to interview Brib Nieblich one of the three Blessed administrators. Brib was a large, dark grey stoneborn with two red sabers at his sides, and a remarkably fast pace for a stoneborn. He was meeting with a researcher when we ran into him, but was happy to answer questions anyway.

He was in charge of security at the facility, and was remarkably chipper about it, given the state of things. Ixze, it should be noted, was not as excited about things, as ze realized that ze had actually met Brib before, however briefly. The last time that Ixze had been here, Brib had demanded that ze and the rest of the party at the time be immediately killed. He had even concussed Naario and Bungus when they had failed to immediately comply. Now Brib had had his reasons, but it was still unsettling at best, and Ixze had a feeling that the fact that Brib had never actually laid eyes on zer was a very fortunate thing indeed.

Despite all that, the conversation went pretty smoothly. Brib reiterated that there was probably nothing going on beyond the pressure spikes, and that those were both unprecedented and accounted for. According to Brib, they had been coming every time a significant force or entity entered the sovereign's realm. When we asked why he wasn't worried about more, Brib said that his reasons were classified, but cited the expertise of a Dr. Blishleigh, who was developing technology to record magical pressure events.

If nothing else, it was nice to get confirmation that at least one of the Blessed wasn't actively trying to kill us. We even managed to get a meeting with Cal Dayileki, the Blessed that developed that generators, set up for the next day.

---

After that, Doktah Dakog insisted on inspecting the medical facilities. We were all a little worried about that, but he went anyway, and Cain followed. The two were greeted by a hangar sized room that had been filled with beds, patients, and frantic healers. After trying and failing to procure a tour guide, they wandered over to the morgue for a little independent investigation and/or supply run. What they found did not disappoint.

Doktuh Dakog MD talked shop with an increasingly concerned mortician as Cain dug through the bodybags. It didn't take long for the mortician to start doubting Doktuh Dakog's MD, but Cain didn't need much time to find what he was after. Cain quietly zipped open a bodybag and casually borrowed an arm from the mortal remains of Dr. Spindling, a former "Chronosplicing researcher". We weren't 100% on what that title meant, but it sounded important enough, and Cain figured that the researcher's arm might come in handy for opening doors.

You might fault the two morticians for not paying closer attention to him, but as that was happening, Doktuh Dakog MD was proving his mettle as a medical professional by slicing open important veins in his arm and bleeding all over everyone. So their plates were pretty full. As soon as Cain had the arm, Doktuh Dakog declared victory, and the two exited the scene.

---

That night, Cain was putting finishing touches on his newest creation when there was a knock at his door. Feeling suspicious at the timing, he sent a bone drone to look through the peephole on the door instead of going himself.

As soon as the drone moved up to the peephole, the door was kicked in with incredible force, knocking the drone away wildly as a pitch black blobular figure smashed into the room. It would have been a hell of an entrance if Cain had answered the door, but he hadn't. He was in fact sitting a few feet away at his desk, activating Folium's panic button, and charging his new toy: A gigantic necrotic cannon made of bone, with a barrel constructed of not one, nor two, nor three, but four ribcages.

As the cannon screamed to life and the alarm blared, the intruder decided that tonight was not their night, and ran. Beams of necrotic energy, several sets of footsteps, and confusing shouting pursued them down the hallway. They took a hit to their side, but managed to keep running, just barely reaching the stairs before being hit in the back with another and faceplanting. By the time they had regained their senses, trees had sprouted from the floor around them, locking them in, and they were surrounded by shouting voices.

# Session 8: Tracking the Beast

We gave the intruder a good shouting over, but they didn't seem to budge. Then we tried the old "bad cop, bad cop, bad cop, bad cop, rookie" routine, but that just got them panicked. Even when Doktuh Dakog started "demonstrating" again, our weird prisoner wouldn't say anything. They just looked terrified and confused, and ended up huddling into as much of a ball as they could without saying anything useful. We didn't like that, so Folium wrapped them tighter in wooden bonds so that only their face could move, and covered them in thorns. That didn't work either though, and by the time the rest of the guards arrived we were discussing the many merits of just having Cain kill and ressurrect them until they talked.

With Naario and Bungus coming in on their spiders, we decided to leave things to the professionals. Unfortunately, the professionals didn't really know any better than we did, and so Naario and Bungus hit the same brick wall as us. Bungus ended up just wrapping the intruder in spiderweb and having his spider stick the poor bastard with something that knocked them out cold. Folium and Cain hopped on the backs of the spiders, and those five all rode back to some security hangar. The rest of us all had to sleep, so we stumbled back to our rooms and did just that.

---

Once the five reached the security hangar, our captive was quickly dropped on a table that had convenient hand and ankle shackles, and quickly chained. Naario then spritzed them with a little something that evaporated the web, and promptly ran off to make sure that guards were posted by our bedrooms.

Once everybody had had a chance to cool off, we had a chance to look over our captive a little more thoroughly. Though we'd initially thought them to be cloaked in dark grey, they appeared to just have near black leathery skin all over their body. In fact, they were completely naked, and utterly devoid of any kind of genitals. Their general shape was broadly orcish, but no one would call them an orc without being told so first. They carried nothing, and seemed sweaty to the touch. Worst of all, a slight stench of old fish hung over them.

Cain started to get geared up to do the whole necromantic interrogation thing, and was a little disappointed when Folium hit a breakthrough.

---

Folium started to press our captive on what exactly their plan was, now that they were captured, and that seemed to get a crack. They seemed to start to realize that they didn't really have one. They didn't really know much of anything. Not only were they unsure of who they had been working for, they weren't even really sure of who or what they were. As it turns out, all that we really had to do was offer a helping hand, and they fell right into it. The only friction came when they complained of exhaustion and begged to be allowed to sleep, but Cain used a necromantic spell to rid them of any need to sleep, eat, breath, age, or really do much of anything other than talk to us for a few days, which got them back on track.

Our captive explained that they had just woken up in a hallway with an understanding that they had to go to a certain room, beat up whoever was inside, and leave quietly. They knew the directions to that room, but not much else. They didn't know why they were doing it, or why that room in particular. The only other other thing that they had been sure of was that it was very important to act quickly, so they had rushed to their mission without a second thought.

Through the interview, Folium was able to get the list of directions that she needed, and we got what we needed to trace back to the spot where our captive had started. A psychic call roused the rest of the group, and we all met up at a very smelly carpet.
