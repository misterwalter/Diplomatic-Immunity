# Session 1: Redemption

Ara lifted her head. They was a grey and wrinkled elvish man across the table from her. That was weird, elves never got grey.

He smiled gently. "Are you ready, Ara? I don't wish to rush you."

She realized that she had no idea where she was, and jolted into alertness. The man seemed to be unarmed, and there wasn't anyone else around, but she couldn't move. Her hands and legs were bound together by some kind of magic, and she couldn't even see a window. That said, the chair that she was in was comfortable enough, and she still had her knife, so she decided to see what he had to say.

What he had to say was bullshit. Apparently she had been identified on the Deshton Reform raid, The Director's eyes had been two of The 10,000, and had managed to report back. Now Redemption had her sister in some kind of stasis bullshit, and they were going to give her up for adoption if Ara didn't knock over some Vershezulite cult. There was a lot of talk of reputational gains, and the limits of what this Sladaaji character could do to protect her, but it was all bullshit. He might have been telling the truth about not liking Deshton Reform, but there was no way to know and no reason to care. Seeing no better option, she agreed. He bonds were dispelled, she was given the name of her first squadmate, and a stack of unsettlingly meticulous dossiers detailing the targets.
