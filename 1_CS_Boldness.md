# Session 1: Raider Skiff Assault

### After Action Report
At 1300 hours, our team of three -- Bee Boi, Malachi Ebonstone, and myself -- departed the northern airbase via powered glider. At 1312, we were released, and dropped toward our target. The slow-fall charms kicked in as expected, and we landed safely on the rigging of the enemy vessel. We proceeded to the bow, accessing a hatch to reach a storage area on the lower deck. A scout detected us immediately before we dropped down; I discharged my rifle in time with a nearby cannon shot and severely injured him, before we lowered ourselves into the ship. We moved down the central passage and were attacked by a raider, whom I dispatched. At this point two more combatants attacked us from behind, and we were forced into a two-sided defense as another descended from the ladder near the stern. As Bee Boi and Malachi engaged the enemies behind us, I opened the door to the back room.

Quick thinking by Bee Boi prevented the ship from detonating. By clouding the room with spores, the magic user within was rendered unable to cast any spells which might have otherwise ended our mission. I barricaded the door while Malachi finished off the guard. We attempted to disable the explosive, but seeing our efforts met with limited success, decided to escape instead; Bee Boi created a hole in the bottom of the ship through which we fled, taking the captive elf with us as a potential source of information.

After recovering in the hospital, the team was granted a week of shore leave. I regret only that the MP sent to ensure my prompt return to the navy had to barge in on such an enjoyable evening. Perhaps if she had deigned to join us when offered, instead of standing there red-faced and sputtering, it could have ended that way.

Allied Casualties: One MP's composure
Enemy Casualties: 5, with one additional captive.

# Session 2: Local Infiltration & Information-Gathering
### After Action Report

Ferried through the unusual bridge, we found ourselves near a lush jungle. Captain Babadreja instructed Bee Boi and I to make contact with the locals and obtain a map of the area. We proceeded into the jungle a short way before spotting fishing nets hanging over the river. We made use of some fast-growing local plant life to reach the treetop village. We contacted a local merchant, who referred us to the village's sheriff (a construct of some sort, of living stone); they both reacted well to our claim to be members of the raiding party -- under the command of an organization referred to only as High Command -- and provided us food and lodging for the night. The next morning, they also provided us two maps and accompanied us to the ship under the impression our captain had been injured.

Fortunately, it seems Captain Babadreja had, in fact, been injured. The sheriff healed Captain Babadreja before departing, and we began our journey upriver with a somewhat better sense of direction than when we had first arrived.

I have submitted a request for a suppressor that could be fitted to my weapon, as well as for a sidearm I could conceal for future field missions where bringing my rifle is out of the question. While firearms proved not to be necessary for this mission, future infiltration missions may not pass so calmly.

I also wish to privately express concern about the emotional state of Bee Boi. I don't care what the paperwork says, this spora is too young to be in the service -- I fear the distance and action may traumatize him. (I needn't remind you of our comparative lifespans, in case you consider my age a logical counterpoint.)

Allied Casualties: None
Enemy Casualties: None

# Session 3: Prisoner Interrogation & Waypoint Search
### After Action Report

The elf that the raiders had been holding captive regained consciousness. On Captain Babadreja's orders, our group interrogated her. Under gentle questioning, she spoke lengthy pleasantries, occasionally interspersed with modicuma of useful information: Her name, Yessica Know. That the world was overseen by a god of some sorts known as the Sovereign, beneath whom were 27 Regents, drawn from an army of Blessed, who in turn come from a legion of Servants by -- according to Yessica -- giving up some of their personhood for power. Among these Regents is the High Command, once one individual, whose power is now distributed among twelve Blessed generals. Presumably this is the force we must contend with to end these attacks.

Following this questioning, the Captain placed Yessica in my custody and ordered us to seek out a Waypoint, a point of constancy in this shifting landscape, or a nearby cult of locals that might help us work against the Sovereign. We began our search at a local farm, run by a canine creature. The farm workers were skeletons. Yessica informed us this wasn't unusual -- that most farms in this place use necromancy to return their dead loved ones as laborers -- and proceeded to make contact. I kept watch from a distance and secured our retreat.

Night fell quite suddenly, and the others reemerged from the cottage, investigating the area. From my vantage point, I spotted the approach of two cavelings. Yessica approached and began to talk with them, an altercation broke out, and she was injured. I circled around the farm to the north, cutting off the cavelings' retreat, until my fellow soldiers reached some sort of agreement and followed them to my location. Yessica informs me this may be just such a "family-oriented organization" who may be able to aid our mission.

I'll file this report upon our return. I wouldn't decline another drink at that time.

# Session 4: Meeting w/ Local Org
### After Action Report

Led by our guides, Lewick and Bensel, we proceeded inland. Our group encountered two entities, a minotaur and a goblin, on camelback. I settled in to snipe at range while Yessica and Malachi proceeded to talk with them. Yessica tells me they claimed to be agents of an entity called the Hunter, possibly one of the Regents she mentioned. The minotaur with improbably long horns (close to five meters, at my estimation -- nearly twice as tall as the creature itself), demanded they prove their loyalty and invoked some kind of magic with an aim to expose their allegiences. When Malachi resisted, he engaged in combat.

My first magazine disabled the minotaur. His squire, the goblin, fled; my second magazine killed his mount. I had hopes of capturing him, but when he attacked Yessica with a crossbow, I had no alternative but to kill him as well.

These creatures disposed of, we were escorted into the cavelings' base, and were introduced to their leader, Cholandra: a tall creature with long pink hair. Yessica seems quite taken with her. We'll hear out her position and see if her organization may be of aid in our mission.

I have reason to believe there may be an unexpected guest aboard our ship. I refuse to speak as to why, but I will investigate upon my return.

Allied Casualties: None
Enemy Casualties: 2, plus one camel.

# Session 5:

# Session 6: Flight & Haven
### After Action Report

Of course, returning wouldn't be that simple. Why should it?

I intended to return to investigate the claim I made in my last report, after forming a mental link with Yessica. However, at the farm, I discovered a sizeable military force -- at least 100 strong, of various species, armed with weaponry suited for close combat, dressed in red and gold metal-based armor -- in red and gold armor amassing there. Relaying this image via the aforementioned link, I decided it would be best to regroup with the others and retreat deeper into the forest, assuming that would prove safer than risking any confrontation with the enemy force.

This conclusion proved correct. No sooner had we left the organization's headquarters than Yessica informed me that the leader, Cholandra, had been betrayed by our guide Luwic. (She presumably learned of this through a similar mind link to that which we now share.) Cholandra engaged the enemy and, from what impressions Yessica has shared, destroyed through means unknown a significant number. Yessica wanted to return and help, but myself and the others thought better, and retreated as planned. Depending on how Cholandra's situation develops, and the effect of this raid on her organization's resources and personnel, we may attempt to mount a rescue mission, on the basis of the operational latitude of the desperate.

At present, we have gained access (please don't ask how) to a safe house of sorts -- Yessica refers to it as a "waypoint" -- containing provisions and equipment. We may retreat further as the situation dictates, but this location seems moderately defensible and is well-stocked.

Allied Casualties: None confirmed. Cholandra is presently unconscious.
Enemy Casualties: 30+

- Io
# Session 7: Cholandra's Trail
### After Action Report

We prepared to depart the waypoint today, but were interrupted by the arrival of a family of satyrs, the Dau family. Apparently they're looking for their son, in league with the Servants. We bade farewell and left when we could, with an aim towards seeking out Cholandra, who Yessica informs us is alive and on the move.

The twin trees of the organization's hideout have been burned to the ground. A token guard remains there, perhaps ten. At the farm, there is significantly more activity. At time of writing, I counted around fifty. Along with the thirty or so slain by Cholandra, there remain perhaps thirty guarding the caravan moving Cholandra and others. I'm not optimistic in recovering Cholandra against that kind of force, but we'll make our best effort.

We've set along the road in the direction we believe Cholandra has been taken. A decapitated camel and scorched wagon suggest we're on the right track.

I again need to express concern about Bee Boi. I don't dispute his usefulness -- by now you've received his report, and communication over that kind of range is invaluable -- but I have serious ethical concerns about continuing to expose him to violence. Surely there must be other talented honeymancers in the corps?

Allied Casualties: None
Enemy Casualties: None

# Session 8: Rescue
### After Action Report

The caravan consisted of three wagon-mounted cages containing prisoners, each driven by a trio of camels. As well were three scouts, three complements of six archers each, a handful of infantry, and one large scaled creature which Yessica insists is called a 'horse'. (It was not a horse.)

Around midday, on Yessica's suggestion, we diverted into the woods and overtook the caravan, advancing about an hour ahead, looking for an opportunity to make the road impassible. This opportunity arose: two bridges over boiling rivers. Bee Boi and Malachi dismantled the first bridge while Yessica and I worked on the second. Disrupting the magic that held the bridge in place left it unstable but appearing somewhat passable.

The caravan dismantled the first wagon to create a new bridge for the first river; during its construction, the 'horse' became agitated (in part due to Bee Boi's envoys) and ate an archer. Six archers and three riders stayed behind with the cage. The new bridge didn't hold and the third wagon eventually broke it. Regrettably, a number of prisoners were lost, as well as the three camels pulling it and one of their riders.

The remaining five archers from the first complement as well as three camel-riders crossed the second bridge individually. The 'horse' then attempted to cross. As planned, the bridge collapsed. Although the creature survived, the rider did not, and the creature fled. Yessica reestablished contact with Cholandra, confirming her presence in the second wagon. I destroyed the cage, freeing Cholandra.

Unfortunately, though unsurprisingly, my position was discovered by the three mounted lancers, and I was forced to flee. Only one succeeded in tailing me through a shroud of projections, and I've managed to disable them.

Allied Casualties: An unknown number of members of Cholandra's organization.
Enemy Casualties: One archer, four lancers, one "horse" rider confirmed. Eight stranded, many dismantled.

- Io

# Session 9: Rescue Pt. II
### After Action Report

The rest of the conflict proceeded smoothly enough. Bee Boi and Malachi mopped up most of the archers, with some ill-advised assistance from Yessica, and I began assisting Cholandra from range. Between the swarm of dismantled body parts and the Blessed traveling with the group, Cholandra has been seriously injured, but we've managed to destroy the remains of the swarm and kill the Blessed.

Yessica captured one of the lancers, and the guards of the first cage have fled. I've taken a sample of the Blessed's skin for alchemical analysis; it has significant protective properties, so if we can reverse-engineer it, it may prove useful. I took measures to destroy the creature's remains.

I regret not containing much detail within this report. We'll begin making our way back immediately with Cholandra; hopefully they will prove a powerful ally in this fight.

Allied Casualties: None
Enemy Casualties: Numerous archers and lancers, one Blessed.

- Io

# Session 10: Return
### After Action Report

We nighted at the waypoint we had stayed in before for safety -- it's not possible to hurt others within these structures. A Dragonborn was in residence, but departed before dawn.

Returning to the river, we found the remains of one of the crewman impaled on a ballista bolt. Some kind of necromantic magic was upon the body, and it struggled to remove the bolt. We proceeded past it, eventually coming upon a wrecked Servants' ship -- some kind of collision with a rock, I believe.

Further downriver we came across our ship and a Servant ship engaged in battle. I attempted to snipe an officer and the ship exploded (I'm fairly certain that wasn't due to my actions). Your first mate, Oliver, was launched quite a ways; it's fortunate he wasn't killed.

I'll skip our recap, since you were there for that. Thanks for the drinks. I needed them.

Cholandra tells me a group called the Agnosies may be able to help put us nearer to the level with the Blessed. Perhaps we can find something on this group within the Stochastices research facility.

We're just about to start our slog. Fifteen miles of marsh and a secret research group that works for the Sovereign ahead.

Allied Casualties: Unknown
Enemy Casualties: 1 vessel, 1 officer, others.

- Io

# Session 11: Part Time Job
### After Action Report

Not long into the swamp we ran into a few stragglers which turned out to be from the Stokastices. They were chasing a man who kept blinking a few feet over -- apparently a student of Chaos, so they later informed us. Most of us hid while Yessica volunteed to help capture him; she mostly got beaten up, but they did manage to take him into custody (though he kept screaming.)

They took us back to the Stokastices headquarters and offered us some temp work. Our cover seems to have held so far; we've volunteered to try and stabilize a tower they have flickering in and out of time. Apparently we'll be on a clock. Hard to say what happens if we run out of time -- maybe lost in time.


# Session 12: Tower Five
### After Action Report

They put us in some magical stabilizing suits with umbilici and sent us into their missing tower, Tower Five. Eerie and dark, about what you'd expect for a tower that had been temporally displaced.

The first floor was overrun with spider eggs, and one quite large green spider corpse. Bee Boi pulled its leg off and unfortunately, this caused it to collapse -- spurring the eggs beneath to waking, which prompted a mad dash past the eggs. Bee Boi cleaned house with a spore burst and we rushed on.

The second floor had some spiders as well -- most in cages, six outside. We opted for a strategy of run-and-gun, fighting only to keep our path clear (mostly) and made for the stairs to the final level.

At the top, we found the damaged stabilizer -- some ceiling had collapsed on it, torn one of the cables that fed energy to it. I managed to figure out how to reconnect it, and presto -- tower stabilized.

# Session 13: Debrief
### After Action Report

Fucking time bullshit.

Anyway, the four of us returned to the Stokastices for our debriefing. We explained our situation to Nario -- he seemed to know a fair bit about our situation -- and he warned us that there were people on our trail already. Apparently we have some sympathetic parties here. He told us how to get to Montelue -- wear a red cloak and walk three days windward without stopping -- but warned us that he didn't know how to get in touch with the Agnosies; apparently they were scattered recently by some kind of offensive from the Sovereign's forces, and are still regrouping from the blow.

Nario promised us he'd get us safely out, but apparently an enforcer at the facility by the name of Neeblich -- stoneborn guy, two sabers -- wasn't having it. We escaped through the ventilation shafts before Neeblich found us. He killed Nario, unfortunately. Further exploration of the vents lead to the discovery of a way back to the road; we took it, and have now retreated from the Stokastices headquarters.

Not far outside, we encountered the still form of Sheeba Dau. Bee Boi is presently administering medical aid.

Allied Casualties: Two.
Enemy Casualties: None.

- Io

# Session 14: Ambush

### After Action Report

Well, so much for medical aid. Sheeba Dau did not need our help. A caveling ranger by the name of Moog has been tracking us, and I believe he was working with the lizardfolk who assaulted our ship earlier, along with the rest of the Dau family, who I'd wager are out for revenge.

We've established a truce for now. Hopefully we can work something out and go our separate ways.

- Io

Allied Casualties: None.
Enemy Casualties: None.

# Session 15: Egress
### After Action Report

Moog agreed to continue the stalemate. He claimed, as a "keeper of the peace" (he claims to be a ranger of this world) that he'd be perfectly happy to see us leave this world in peace, and has offered to take us to the portal and open it for us. Seeing as we've now accepted this offer, it seems that's the course we're taking.

I still have reservations about trusting Moog -- or more precisely, about keeping the Dau's alongside. If we're likely to see violence, I anticipate it will come from them demanding my blood. Perhaps we should simply be prepared to give me to them.

The following day, Bee Boi's bird friend returned with the sniper's eyeball. We took it to see Moog, turns out it's one of the Ten Thousand Eyes -- part of a Regent. Needless to say, that doesn't exactly improve my confidence in Moog. We've come up with an arrangement for now: It will have freedom within Moog's room, but when it needs to leave, we bag it.

Hopefully this ends well.

- Io

Allied Casualties: None.
Enemy Casualties: None.

# Session 16: Rays
### After Action Report

Not a day sailing without some adventure. We encountered a bunch of "boilway rays" (according to Yessica) seeming to be reproducing in the middle of the river; although we dropped anchor to avoid running into them, someone or something spurred them into action; we managed to destroy them, though the ship suffered some damage in the process. (I also need to requisition some more materials for armsmithing.)

A few days downriver now. We're at the mouth of the portal, many days early, and apparently Moog can't open the portal after all. So instead we're setting up camp in the branches of one of the nearby trees. Hopefully we won't run into trouble while we wait.

- Io

Allied Casualties: None.
Enemy Casualties: None?

# Session 17: Farming
### After Action Report

Yessica departed by joining herself to Cholandra.

Moog asked us to check up on a friend of his, Kungus Fungo. We brought the lizardfolk prisoner, Ixze, along for an appearance of authority. Apparently Kungus has been growing some kind of ferns and it got out of control. We made to leave, but he insisted on reactivating his harvesters -- turns out they were tuned for 'any living thing' and chased us out. I took a wound to my leg, but it's not too severe. Kungus and Moog have been reunited.

- Io

Allied Casualties: One.
Enemy Casualties: One piece of autonomous farming equipment.

# Session 18: A Failure to Communicate
### After Action Report #18

Moog got some kind of ping about an enormous threat -- something dangerous to the Sovereign -- then things went all stretchy and next thing I knew everything looked like yarn. But it turns out it was us who were yarn. We went to meet with some Servants and hopefully help them fight whatever it was, but they carted Moog off and although they healed him, they didn't seem keen on helping us help them.

So I threatened to kill all of us. I think the negotations were going well, until Malachi punched a guard.

Lovely.

- Io

Allied Casualties: About to be 6.
Enemy Casualties: About to be 23.

# Session 19: Detonation
### After Action Report

This update is primarily to update the casualty list. We survived the battle and have forced one of the enemy combatants to un-yarn us.

Allied Casualties: None.
Enemy Casualties: 18 or more.

- Io

# Session 20: Confusion*
### After Action Report

Gessly, the enemy we forced to help us, was offered a chance to help her comrades; she directed us to their medic, Varden, who seemed to have been overwhelmed by some kind of warping. When we healed Varden, Gessly started acting oddly -- we were forced to kill her.

Varden seems extremely confused. None of us are quite sure what's wrong with her, but her story keeps changing a little. She mentioned that she was expecting enemies from a place called Teromir, reportedly a world full of demons -- it's possible that's just propaganda and a reference to Doo'in. We're bringing her back with us for now; she may have useful information, and at any rate, needs more assistance than we can offer her right now.

Allied Casualties: None.
Enemy Casualties: None.

# Session 21: Time Warp Again
### After Action Report

It seems something unusual is going on. The Servants have set up camps around some kind of lake, according to the map we've obtained. Bee Boy sustained an injury and we went with him and a Servant to one of them, where we learned we were wanted (unsurprising, but the confirmation is useful). Three of the guards tried to take us in, and when we refused to go with them, they resorted to force. As did we.

Along this time, there was some kind of timeline split. I'm not perfectly sure what's going on, but we've met with another Bee Boi, who was not accompanied by myself and Malachi -- he went to the camp alone. Along the same lines, we found our own corpses. So I'll be filing for my life insurance upon my return.

We're moving to a waypoint called Waypoint Glassheart. The Bee Bois are going to remain outside, in case the waypoint's magic would undo them, and I'll be staying with them since I don't need sleep. Ixze, Malachi, and Lieutenant Babadreja are resting within for tonight.

Allied Casualties: 2 or more.
Enemy Casualties: Two wounded, one heavily.

# Session 22: Moog
### After Action Report

Moog ran into us outside Waypoint Glassheart. Nearly killed him. Decided to talk instead. Apparently he's the one who killed me, so that was an interesting conversation.

We're headed your way. Talk soon.

Allied Casualties: None.
Enemy Casualties: None.

- Io

# Session 22i: The Loss of the CS Boldness
Io returned to the ship following Moog, but with her rifle at the ready. She was the one in control now. They took a small rowboat from a servant camp dock, and stole across the water to the CS Boldness.

7 minutes after a rope was tossed from the deck of the CS , all aboard save Io took to the lifeboats. The crew all claim that Io ordered them all to abandon ship, wielding explosives, and threatening their lives if they stayed.
9 minutes later, the CS Boldness exploded. Io has been missing in action ever since, and has filed no further reports.

# Session 23: Get to Ground
