# Session 11: Mission Accomplished
Once everyone was aboard the ship, Captain Psychrus took a moment to say a few words thanking them for their service, and mourning the loss of all those crew left behind on the other side. While Cholandra's massive and redundant frame did draw a few kinds of stares, the newcomers were welcomed aboard with the rest of the former CS Boldness crew. The Council Worlds were accepting places after all, and Psychrus's crew immediately set into what hospitality they coud manage, swiftly followed by introductions and a great swapping of stories. Captains Babadreja and Psychrus retreated to Psychrus's quarters for whisky and a debrief.

---

After a day of cramped quarters and otherwise pleasant sailing, the ship came to dock at Chs'oh. At the time, Chs'oh was a lively port city, famous for its radiant architecture. From the slips to the skyline, everything was made of carefully fitted polished stone of every imaginable color. The city itself was prosperous, and in typical council fashion, the abundant wealth was spread amongst the people, who paid their dues in labors or prayers at their own discretion.

Captain Psychrus discretely lead the survivors through a few city blocks to an administrative center, where they were divided into three groups. The crew of the CS Boldness was interviewed in one are, the Cholandrans in another, and the away team in a small courtyard at the center of the building a few stories up.

Now, it's worth noting that at the time, nobody really thought much of bringing The Director with us. It seemed better to keep her out of trouble, and after all, she was supposed to be totally under control. I mean, she was dead after all. Hindsight is 20/20 though, and foresight is certainly not, so she was there the whole time as we talked with Captain Saigai.

The first thing this new captain explained to us was that she didn't have a ship, she was more of a captain by rank. We didn't really care much, but it was fun trivia.

We got into it properly after that though. Saigai started by grilling us about the loss of the ship, and Io. She had read all of Io's reports, and hadn't thought that someone so fastidious would have acted so recklessly. We didn't say much. She kept trying to get us to say literally anything about the diplomats or where they had gone or if they were okay, but we knew nothing because we had been barred from knowing anything, so she eventually relented.

It was a little tense, so she tried to butter us up with some good news. The Bee Boiz could go home! They just had to prove that they had some kind of parent or guardian to put on the paperwork. The director graciously and raucously volunteered, and the matter was settled, for the most part. Saigai kept saying that they might want to stay in by the end of the meeting, which was a little ominous. There were some questions raised about The Director's "status", but she was able to appear lively enough to handle some good little boiz, and was granted guardianship despite her condition.

From there the conversation got a little more serious as we discussed the big picture. Saigai wanted to know what we thought of this Sovereign character, and what its deal was. In short, what will it take for The Council to liberate that world? How receptive were the people to new leadership? How receptive might this Sovereign be to joining a wider team? Given the last month, and Yessica's entire life, that was a bit mind boggling for us to have to answer. We opened with a firm "no", but allowed ourselves to be talked down to a "maybe" when talk of massive fleets of airships and one or more gods of war were brought into the mix. The best expression of our verdict on that front was that after the meeting, everyone but Yessica did their best to resign.

Saigai did talk a little bit about moving more slowly and maybe doing something more covert, but we weren't really interested in that either. Everyone seemed to agree that a rushdown mass attack on The Sovereign was the best way to do things, but we differed on whether even that had much of a chance. In the end we voted in favor of it, though I couldn't say why.

After that exhausting debrief, we headed across the street to a hotel. Yessica joined the Cholandrans in their penthouse, and Malachi and the Bee Boiz all piled into a room of their own. Yessica heard from Cholandra that the Cholandrans had had a thorough, but fairly painless debrief, and had been offered a place in Doo'in for the time being. They had voted against further relataliation against The Sovereign, seeing it as pointless, but they didn't mind our choice much. After all, they were free and clear, it was us that might have to go back.

One of the Bee Boiz went to see Captain Babadreja when he returned. The captain was flopped out on his bed alone in his room. As the two began to talk, the captain rose, but only to start pawing through the minibar. Babadreja revealed that he had been offered a second chance, and a second ship. A top of the line airship prototype, and first pick of the nearby naval academy's graduating class to replenish his crew. He talked about being happy to be up in the air where he wouldn't be cornered so easily again.

As they talked for a while, the two inevitably turned to Io. Bee Boi asked him to please keep an eye out for her, and to be sure she gets home safe. Captain Babadreja promised he would, and admitted that he was going back in part to see if she was still out there. He just didn't understand why she did that, or any of this, really, and he couldn't just walk away from dead crew or dead friends.

The two sat for a while after that, and Bee Boi went back to his room.

---

Bee Boi had trouble sleeping that night, so he stayed up and drew some pictures. The first was of a starry night, but all the stars were falling out of the sky. There were people flying all around the stars. The second was a hand grasping a flame, and being burned down to the bone. They were both pretty good, but the second one felt happier to him. He picked them up and turned to go show them to The Director, and then froze.

She didn't have any eyes.

She definitely had eyes before, but now the sockets were just empty, and she didn't seem to have noticed.

Bee Boi thought for a moment, and then panicked. He ran to Yessica's room with the Cholandrans and started frantically pounding on the door, and yelling for Yessica. Yessica came and started to ask about a nightmare, but Bee Boi cut her off and dragged her back to his room.

"Here eyes are gone!" He frantically gestured at The Director's impassive face. "Does there - is there any way - isn't there some kind of god of eyes or regent or something?" He sputtered.

"Well yes, the 10,000 eyes are a sort of spy network-OH SHIT" Yessica cut herself off this time, and the two quickly woke Malachi and the other boi while realizing the impact of what had just happened. The Director had seen all of their plans. The eyes knew that the already risky surprise attack was coming, and the eyes were missing.

The four of them piled out into the hallway to find the eyes, and saw a lanky figure silently step rise from doing something with Captain Babadreja's door handle, and moved to step into his room.

A Bee Boi sent a bee to sting the figure, who batted it aside with uncanny grace, but Yessica instantly reacted with a ward upon the figure, which stuck, albeit barely. The figure could harm no one until provoked.

The Captain, thoroughly drunk and completely exhausted, rose from his bed and composed himself just enough to awkwardly stagger past his assailant, who reached out but could not touch his victim. As Babadreja staggered down the hall to the elevator we shouted at him to get Captain Saigai and all the backup he could muster. All the while the figure stepped back into the hallway, revealing itself to be a tall leathery felian, armed with a variety of knives.

Yessica asked what the felian was doing here, and he just laughed, insulted her, and charged, bouncing between floor, walls and ceiling as he closed.

Now, we all knew that Yessica had said she got him with her ward, but it takes an act of faith to really believe it, especially when the target is clearly Blessed. He called out Malachi with a few insults, drew his blades, and went right for the poor vampire dwarf's throat, all while keeping his own head tantalizingly steady. Even as his blades slowed to a stop at Malachi's neck, he eyed Malachi's balled fists and gave a cocky little "I've got you now" grin.

It took everything Malachi had to not punch him in the face, but Malachi pulled through. He held his ground, and as the grin turned to disappointment, Malachi took a bit of it for his own. The leathery felian spat, called us all cowards, sprinted down the hallway, and dove out through the window. We followed as quick as we could, but he was clearly Blessed, and there was no way we could catch him.

After we had a moment to collect ourselves, Captain Saigai came out of an elevator and started demanding to know what had happened. Guards swarmed the building and the neighborhood, and the whole place was on lockdown for an hour or two. As far as anyone could tell, the assassin had just been working their way down the hallway, and had already hit two rooms before the captain's. It wasn't anybody we really knew, but it was still hard to hear.

We never found the leathery felian, but we did find how they got there. They had rolled all the way down the hall and down the stairs. There was a little alcove under the bottom flight of stairs where they had drawn out little runes in their own blood to make some kind of tiny portal, barely big enough to fit crawl through. Neither eye was found, but the runes were recorded, and the portal was destroyed.

---

That was plenty for Malachi and The Bee Bois, and they got on their way the next morning. The Director was given a blindfold with eyes drawn on to keep her from scaring anyone, and it seemed to work better than you'd think. Everyone had been given a hero's pension, so it was a pretty optimistic sendoff. There was a lot of talk of where they wanted to set up a house now that they were immortal and rich, and all sorts of plans for the four of them to stay in touch. The last we saw of them, for a while anyway, was them just walking off into the rising sun together, which I happen to think is about the best way to go.
