# Diplomatic-Immunity
The Full and Public Story of the Diplomatic Immunity Campaign, a long term game of [Imperial Dawn](https://imperialdawn.com/#!/) being played more or less weekly over the internet.

[Season 1 (incomplete)](https://github.com/misterwalter/Diplomatic-Immunity/blob/master/1_CS_Boldness.md)

[Season 2 (incomplete, still running)](https://github.com/misterwalter/Diplomatic-Immunity/blob/master/2_Lost_in_the_City.md)

As the campaign is still running, certain facts are being left out to avoid spoilers. Some inaccuracies are being left as recorded by the players at the time. However, I am taking great pains not to introduce any new inaccuracies as I (the GM) make this record.
